# State of the Art Research
Some of the files were added under GIT-LFS, namely the PDFs with the SoA research.

The steps followed were:
- On the repo settings, turn on the "Include Git LFS objects in archives".
- sudo apt install git-lfs
- git lfs track thesis/refs/pdfs/*.pdf
- git add thesis/refs/pdfs/*.pdf
- Commit/Push as usual
